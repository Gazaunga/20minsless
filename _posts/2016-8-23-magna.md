## Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)

The editor of this blog, Jeremy, who happens to be my boyfriend, seems to ardently believe that the only legitimate way to use this space is to teach Dialectical Behavioral Therapy skills. Let the record show that this perturbs me. I cannot tell you exactly why this perturbs me, and if you continue to press me for the answer I will only become more perturbed.

Jeremy has said to me on many occasions that the best way to learn something is to teach it. Does he not realize that I know this already? Does he think that I am trying to learn DBT? I mean, I am, in some sense, but I am also not, in another. I suppose it would help if you had some backstory. Unfortunately, I don't have time to get into that now. You'll have to wait until next week.
